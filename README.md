## Tech Stack
- **GitHub** - Version control and collaboration
- **Jenkins** - CI/CD automation
- **Docker** - Containerization of applications
- **AWS EC2** - Hosting environment

## DevOps Workflow
1. **Code Push & Version Control**: Developers commit code to **GitHub** (master or develop branch).
2. **Jenkins Automation**: Webhooks trigger Jenkins pipelines to build, test, and deploy.
3. **Build & Test**:
   - If pushed to `develop` branch â†’ Test the application.
   - If pushed to `master` branch â†’ Build, test, and deploy to production.
4. **Dockerization**: Application is containerized using **Docker**.
5. **Deployment**: Dockerized application is deployed to **AWS EC2**.

## Jenkins Pipeline Jobs
- **Job 1**: Build the application
- **Job 2**: Run automated tests
- **Job 3**: Deploy to production (only for `master` branch commits)

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install necessary dependencies using a configuration management tool.
3. Set up **Jenkins Webhooks** for GitHub integration.
4. Configure the **Jenkinsfile** to automate build, test, and deployment stages.
5. Deploy the containerized application on **AWS EC2**.

## Conclusion
This project successfully integrates DevOps best practices, ensuring **automated, scalable, and reliable** software deployment. ðŸš€
